What is PKCS Digital Certificate?

Certificate is a document that lists public key
along with the rightful owner(IP address, email
address, phone number, website's domain, real
life name, identity card and any other that might
be applicable).

Certificate by itself is not worthy to use. To make
it worthy to use, it often use in conjunction with
PKI(Public Key Infrastructure).

When certificate is "worthy" to use, it often use
in establishing a secure connection with the
server/website or to prove a document belong to
a rightful owner or use internally in company/
corporate to create a permission system on
certain part of their corporate system.
