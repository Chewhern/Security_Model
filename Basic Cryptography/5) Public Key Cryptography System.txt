What is Public Key Cryptography System?

Public Key Cryptography System or PKCS was responsible for securely
sharing key(symmetric encryption) between trusted parties. Unlike
symmetric encryption, PKCS consists of one public key and one private
key.

In digital world, PKCS's public key and private key is either in binary
numbers or normal large numbers. Let's try and look at a more user-
friendly example. Let's imagine, you have a mailbox and its corresponding
address, the paper mail's delivery guy delivers the mail to your mailbox.
Presuming your mailbox was locked with a lock, only you are able to unlock
the mailbox because you own the mailbox's lock key. 

The mailbox, its corresponding address and the lock was public. This was
public key. The key to unlock the lock on mailbox is private key.

The argument in PKCS was if only public key was given, the attacker or
non-trusted parties are unable to get the private key. It's not
saying that this process is not possible.. However.., it's consider
a life time of a universe to find private key through public key.

In computer terms, this was call "solving the discrete logarithm problem".

Anytime you visit the browser or website, you are using PKCS unconsciously
to secure the connection with a symmetric key.
