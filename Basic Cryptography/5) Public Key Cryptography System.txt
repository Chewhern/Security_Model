What is Public Key Cryptography System?

Public Key Cryptography System or PKCS was responsible for securely
sharing key(symmetric encryption) between trusted parties. Unlike
symmetric encryption, PKCS consists of one public key and one private
key.

In digital world, PKCS's public key and private key is either in binary
numbers or normal large numbers. 

The argument in PKCS was if only public key was given, the attacker or
non-trusted parties are unable to get the private key. It's not
saying that this process is not possible.. However.., it's consider
a life time of a universe to find private key through public key.

In computer terms, this was call "solving the discrete logarithm problem".

Anytime you visit the browser or website, you are using PKCS unconsciously
to secure the connection with a symmetric key.
