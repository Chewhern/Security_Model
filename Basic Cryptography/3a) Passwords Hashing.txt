In last document, we talk about hashing(cryptography).

When we supply passwords to our hashing algorithm, we will be able to use
the human fingerprint version of passwords as a key for symmetric
encryption. If developer/programmer/coder store the passwords in
fingerprint format, when we as a user type in a password, the password
go through hashing process, if the inputted fingerprint matched with the
fingerprint that's stored on server that you submit during
registration match, the system will let you in. 

However.., there's a concern in which developer/coder/programmer/company
does not know what they are doing with passwords. In this link,
https://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/hash/, there's a section called
"algorithm". If the developer uses any of the algorithm starting from
(old standard) "md2" to "SHA256" (excluding the algorithm that starts from
ripemd128 to the lowest algorithm). It itself is a time bomb.

You can go to this website "https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords" to check
if your passwords have been leaked/breached/stolen through any server gets
hacked incident.

The proper hashing algorithm to hash passwords was to use a special method
call PBKDF2 or Argon2 with Blake2B/Blake3 or SHA generation 3(Keccak/SHAKE)
hashing algorithm.

If the passwords are not hashed with PBKDF2/Argon2, then you should be able
to find your passwords at that link.

The proper way to deal with passwords can be found on computerphile youtube
channel.
