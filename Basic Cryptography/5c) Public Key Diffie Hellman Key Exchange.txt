What is Public Key Diffie Hellman Key Exchange?

Diffie Hellman Key Exchange or DFKX or KX is a special way to share
a symmetric key. In simplified terms, 2 parties(trusted) generate
public and private key. They exchange each other public key and mix
the exchanged public key with private key to get a shared secret.

In industry, the shared secret might be too short(refers to symmetric
encryption documents) or too long. That's why they usually use it
with cryptography hashing algorithm.

I am not qualified to explain this, please refer to this link for

It's better that you watch these 2 videos as color example alone
might not explain the whole picture.
