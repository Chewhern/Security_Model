What is MAC(Message Authentication Code)?

When we encrypt message with stream cipher, the message is encrypted but
this does not stop attacker/hacker from being able to change or tamper
with the encrypted message due to the XOR operation used in stream cipher.

We use cryptography hashing in a special way to generate a special random
unique "summary" that only a certain party can generate the same "summary".
This special technique is called MAC(Message Authentication Code). This 
specially random generated "summary" will append to the encrypted message
to prevent the stream cipher encrypted message from being changed/tampered.
