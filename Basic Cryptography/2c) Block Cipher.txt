Block Cipher is another type of symmetric encryption.

Block cipher takes 128 bits of messages as a block and encrypt the
content of the block into cipher text.

Assume our message was "I'm feeling good", when we convert it into
binary numbers, we should get 128 bits of message in binary format.

Our key was "Demonstration222", when we convert it into binary numbers,
we should get 128 bits of key in binary format.

You can play with block cipher through this link:

When you play with this link, choose "Hex" in both "Output Text Format"
and "Input Text Format". If you have done this correctly, you should be
able to encrypt/decrypt properly.

If you want to supply your own key, 128 bits refers to 16 bytes or refers
to 16 english characters(including spaces and special characters), 192 bits
refers to 24 bytes and 256 bits refers to 32 bytes.
