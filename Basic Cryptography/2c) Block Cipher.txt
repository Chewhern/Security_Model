Block Cipher
Let’s assume we want to encrypt a message of “The first thing ”, if you count the
number of characters (include spaces) in the message, you will see that it’s
exactly 16 characters. Block cipher refers to you take exactly 16 characters and
perform encryption on the 16 characters and produces encrypted text which looks
similar to “8Rs6GxTgG1RZhrJe/li6Pg==” (Base 64) or
“F11B3A1B14E01B545986B25EFE58BA3E” (Hexadecimal number).

For decryption you take the encrypted text which could be very long and block
cipher will also use the same way that it uses on performing encryption to perform
decryption.
