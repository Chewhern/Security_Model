What is passphrase?
Passphrase was a better replacement for passwords. It intends to solve the good and
strong passwords user experience aspect by making it friendlier to users.

A strong password generally appears like this.

A passphrase generally appears like this.

This is the old words list. (https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc)

This is the new words list. (https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt)

The idea of passphrase was to roll a dice six times to randomly choose a single word that
is available in the list. The list mostly contains English words and occasionally some
symbols and numbers. It’s friendlier to users as they need to memorize only the
English words but not some nonsensible mixture of characters, symbols and numbers.

In 2018, Computerphile makes a video about Diceware & Passwords. In that video,
Dr Mike Pound stated 4-5 words chosen by rolling dices was consider a good and strong
enough replacement to password.

If there’s a need to add more words, the security of the passphrase will only increase.
In cryptocurrency wallet and in some cases, users will realized that the developer
chooses 12-15 words that exist in the passphrase list.

Passphrase is better than password in all aspects but not many websites or services
support the use of passphrase as we know some of the services force users to
include symbols like “!@#$%^&*()” and in some cases include numbers as well.

I am not a good explainer in explaining the difference between passphrase and passwords.
Hopefully, someone can explain better than I do.

Most of the problems that exist in passwords generally do not exist in passphrase except
problem number 4th that exist in password. Users can only blame developers/companies
/corporate at this point and there’s nothing they can do.
