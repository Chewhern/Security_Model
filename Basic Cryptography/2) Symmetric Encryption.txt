Let’s imagine you have a box, a lock and a key. The lock was built-in to the box which it
uses only a single key to lock/unlock the box. For the sake of argument, the box, the
lock and the key is indestructible.

When you want to lock or unlock the box, you use only a single key to do it.

You can imagine the key was your password as it’s the easiest way to understand. You use
your password to lock or unlock the box.

If locking and unlocking the box involves with only a single key such as password,
this was called as single key encryption or in official terms it was called symmetric encryption.

We are obviously not dealing with boxes in real world. This is just the concept for you to understand.

Single key encryption or symmetric encryption is generally used in internet or in computer world.
People prefer to use symmetric encryption because the speed in performing encryption or
decryption is extremely fast.

However, there’s a problem in using symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses only a single key
such as password to perform both encryption and decryption. Users have to consider how to deliver the
password or the key to the recipient safely.
If you use (exclude end to end encryption) email such as Google mail or Microsoft email/phone calling
or video calling or voice calling, these options are not recommended because the potential key or
password could be known by third party.

The security of symmetric encryption relies on the users to keep the key or password safe,
confidential and secure. Any attacker can’t break the “box or the lock built-in to the box”-
symmetric encryption algorithm, the only possible attack they could do is to steal or
to guess your key/password.

There’re more details but I will leave it for you to discover.
