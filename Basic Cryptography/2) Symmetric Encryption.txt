What is symmetric encryption?

Symmetric encryption is a encryption/decryption process that uses only single key.
You can think of symmetric encryption as a simple lock on our physical door that has
only one lock and one key.

In digital world, you can assume the key was your password. You use the password to
encrypt/decrypt data.

Symmetric encryption is a very fast encryption process. However.., it becomes a problem.
Why? If you encrypt a document/data with passwords, you have to find some way to share the
passwords with others. If you share it on phone/video/voice call or through email or through
some messenger like WeChat(exclude whatsapp/signal/session/threema/matrix), the chances is
other unwanted third party may know your passwords. Hence the encryption that you put onto
the data/document is useless. 

There're 2 types of symmetric encryptions:
1. Stream Cipher
2. Block Cipher

In general there're 3 standard sizes for symmetric encryption, which are 128 bits, 192 bits
and 256 bits.

These sizes have a meaning. Other documents may describe it.
