What is cryptography hashing?
Cryptography hashing is a process where you turns incredibly small or huge amount of data into fixed
size of a random unique nonsense or summary.

Cryptography hashing is a one way process of turning data into random non sensible unique summary.

It's generally used in data integrity,authentication and expanding/shrinking data.

Let's assume that you are reading a novel or watching a movie. The summary or introduction summarizes
the novel content and the movie content. You can think of cryptography hashing as random unique
summarized novel content and movie content(summary/introduction). If summary or introduction does not
exist, we as a viewer/reader need to go through the whole content of the movie/novel to understand
the content of movie/novel. Not to mention during the process, the novel/movie that we received
may miss some parts of the content or data and might not be authentic. You may not notice it
but when we receive software/files online(presumably receive by downloading) have a small not
sensible random summary which users can verify through cryptography hashing process.

Here's a simple toy that you can play with.

The real life application of cryptography hashing includes but not limit to:
1. They can be used to make a summary of the passwords
2. They can be used to make a summary of files/documents/softwares/data
3. The summarized passwords can be used as a source for encryption/decryption keys
