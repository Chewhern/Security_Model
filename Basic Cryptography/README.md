## Continuation of Symmetric Encryption Key Sizes

A lot of people may not understand what is 128 bits,192 bits and 256 bits key size.

### 128 bits key size
In 128 bits key size, the initial value was 0 and the last (long) value was
``` 
1797693134862315907729305190789024733617976978942306572734300811577326758

7245938479716304835356329624224137215.
```

The key can be any value starting from 0 to that huge number shown above.\
Assuming the key was randomly generated, it has the value of\
72081832065758414117397666685607916814

There're approximate an average of
340282366920938463463374607431768211456 combinations to go through.

What an attacker has to do was to start from initial value 0 and keep on
incrementing by 1 till they reach the randomly generated value. This is a
task that needs life time of a universe to go through. In computer terms,
this is call brute forcing.

The same can be said to 192 bits and 256 bits.

### 192 bits key size
In 192 bits the last (long) value was
```

### Quantum Computer
When big scale of QC arrived, all the average combinations(128 bits,
192 bits, 256 bits) was reduced by 50%. If that's the case, 256 bits
of key sizes should be able to withstand the attacks of QC.
