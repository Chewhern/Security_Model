What is public key encryption(asymmetric encryption)?

Public Key Encryption or Asymmetric encryption is a PKCS system
that uses public key to encrypt and private key to decrypt.

We can try to understand public key encryption with a real life example.
Let's assume we have sender and recipient. Sender wants to send a physical
mail to recipient. The sender gets the recipient mail box address and throws
the mail into the mailbox of the recipient. The recipient mail box was locked
with a key and lock. Anyone can send email to the recipient mail box but only
the recipient is able to unlock the mailbox and read all the mails.

The mail box address and lock is public key and the mailbox key was private key.

In PKCS, the encryption will always be fast but the decryption will always
depends on the key sizes. The bigger the key sizes, the slower the decryption
process.

Unlike symmetric encryption, the splitting of data into block and encrypt
/decrypt the block in PKCS encryption/decryption is not automatic. It's harder
to split data into block and encrypt in PKCS encryption/decryption as it's
very easy to mess up compare to symmetric encryption.
