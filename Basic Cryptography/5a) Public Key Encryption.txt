What is public key encryption(asymmetric encryption)?

Public Key Encryption or Asymmetric encryption is exactly the mailbox
example described in public key cryptography system document.

If you want to play with asymmetric encryption, here's the link.

In PKCS, the encryption will always be fast but the decryption will always
depends on the key sizes. The bigger the key sizes, the slower the decryption
process.

Unlike symmetric encryption, the splitting of data into block and encrypt
/decrypt the block in PKCS encryption/decryption is not automatic. It's harder
to split data into block and encrypt in PKCS encryption/decryption as it's
very easy to mess up compare to symmetric encryption.
