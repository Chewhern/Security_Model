What is PKI(Public Key Infrastructure)?

Public Key Infrastructure is a cryptography mechanism in which
we try to solve the identity problem in PKCS.

I am not qualified to explain how PKI works, for more
details. Please refer to this link below.

PKI itself is not a 100% secure system, the private key
that they used to sign the certificate or public key
will have a chance to expose to the internet through
any data leakage/breaches incident. If the private key
was leaked/breached on PKI service provider, the whole
PKI mechanism breaks(to an extent).

The certificate that we send to PKI service provider
will also have a chance to leak the private information
associated on it.

These 2 flaws are not solvable, any online secure internet
connection to a server/website will always need to bear with
the risks/drawbacks associated with PKI.

PKI by itself is suitable in environment that prefers
security but not privacy.
