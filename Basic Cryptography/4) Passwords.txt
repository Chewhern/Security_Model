Passwords in general is a problematic login approach
or as a source for encryption keys.

In general on user side, these are the basic golden rules that
must be followed.
1. Users should not choose short passwords
2. Users should not choose common passwords
3. Users should not choose passwords that have been leaked/breached
/stolen (can refers to this link
"https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords")
4. Users should not reuse passwords

We are both users and coders/developers/programmer, we know these 4
golden rules won't be followed by public. Hence.., if the passwords
are weak, the login that uses passwords or the encryption keys
that uses passwords are worthless/useless.
