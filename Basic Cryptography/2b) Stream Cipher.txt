What is bits?
Computers are generally operating in binary number system (0,1) whereas human uses decimal
or base 10 number (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) system. Bits are one of the computer terms.

Let’s look at an example. When we want to pay 2 dollar to a convenient store staff, we
take out our wallet and count 1 dollar.. 2 dollar. Once we think that there’s enough
money we proceed to give the staff 2 dollar as a payment.

In human world we can count up from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11……., this is how we
count numbers and how we deal with numbers.

In computer world, it was represented differently. What you need to look at was the
computer representation of numbers after the “?-” symbols.
0?-00, 1?-01, 2?-10, 3?-11
4?-100, 5?-101, 6?-110, 7?-111
8?-1000, 9?-1001, 10?-1010, 11?-1011, 12?-1100

Let us use the above reference as an example. 
0/1/2/3 has 2 bits,
4/5/6/7 has 3 bits,
8/9/10/11/12 has 4 bits.
Bit(s) is essentially how many reserved space that are responsible for storing the
different combination of 0 or 1. People can say 1 bit, it just mean there’s 1
reserve space that can either store 0 or 1. When people say 2 bits, it means there’re
2 reserve spaces that can either store all 0 or all 1 or a combination of 0 and 1.
