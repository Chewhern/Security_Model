What is Encryption/Decryption?

In computer terms, encryption is a process of scrambling data from sensible/readable
format into non sensible/readable format with the help of key. Decryption is a process
of scrambling data from non sensible/readable format into sensible/readable format with
the help of key. If any parties possess the key, they can read it, else they can't read
the encrypted message. 

Let's assume that you have an important physical valuable asset, you put that asset into
a lockable box and locks it. This process was call encryption. If you unlock the lock on
the box and take the asset out, this process was call decryption.
