What is bits?
Computers are generally operating in binary number system (0,1) whereas human
uses decimal or base 10 number (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) system. Bits are one of
the computer terms.

Let’s look at an example. When we want to pay 2 dollar to a convenient store
staff, we take out our wallet and count 1 dollar.. 2 dollar. Once we think that
there’s enough money we proceed to give the staff 2 dollar as a payment.

In human world we can count up from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11……., this is how we
count numbers and how we deal with numbers.

In computer world, it was represented differently. What you need to look at was the
computer representation of numbers after the “?-” symbols.
0?-00, 1?-01, 2?-10, 3?-11
4?-100, 5?-101, 6?-110, 7?-111
8?-1000, 9?-1001, 10?-1010, 11?-1011, 12?-1100

Let us use the above reference as an example. 
0/1/2/3 has 2 bits,
4/5/6/7 has 3 bits,
8/9/10/11/12 has 4 bits.

Bit(s) is essentially how many reserved space that are responsible for storing the
different combination of 0 or 1. People can say 1 bit, it just mean there’s 1 reserve
space that can either store 0 or 1. When people say 2 bits, it means there’re 2 reserve
spaces that can either store all 0 or all 1 or a combination of 0 and 1.

Modern Industry Single Key Key Size or Symmetric Key Sizes
In modern industry, symmetric encryption’s key have 3 specific key
sizes which are 128 bits, 192 bits and 256 bits.

128 bits refer to there are 128 reserve spaces that can store either
all 1 or all 0 or a combination of 0 and 1. The same goes for 192 bits
and 256 bits.

In symmetric encryption, they accept any key values with different
range as shown below.

128 bits accept value starting from “0” to
“340282366920938463463374607431768211455”
(2^128 – 1 or 2 to the power of 128 -1)
Considering that your key was chosen at random which has the
value of “170141183460469231732840225220490952705”. 
Any attacker has to start from 0 then increment it by 1 until it reaches
the value that you use for encryption and decryption. 
In average an attacker has to go through “340282366920938463463374607431768211456”
(2^128 or 2 to the power of 128) different combinations or possible values which is
not doable and even if it’s doable, the time needed for them to do so will be consider
as life time of a universe. If the attacker was lucky perhaps they only need to go
through “18446744073709551616” (2^64 or 2 to the power of 64) different combinations
or possible values.

192 bits and 256 bits act in a similar way like 128 bits.

When big quantum computer comes, 256 bits of symmetric encryption key size is enough
to withstand the quantum computer. The average combinations or possible values
that an attacker or hacker have to go through was reduced by 50%.
