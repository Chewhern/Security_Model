What is Public Key Digital Signatures?

PKCS digital signature is designed for solving data integrity and authenticity.
You can assume PKCS digital signature acts the same like real life signature but
better in all aspects.

If you are able to understand PKCS, you will know that PKCS consists of public key
and private key. Given only public key, it's computational impossible to find the
private key.

In PKCS digital signature, we reverse the roles of the keys. We use private key
to encrypt data and public key to decrypt data. It's very similar to asymmetric
encryption or public key encryption. 

It works by hashing the data(document/files/others that might be applicable) to
create a random unique nonsense summary, we then use our private key to encrypt/sign
that summary. We send the encrypted summary along with the document to the recipient.

You as a sender don't care for confidentiality but you do care for data integrity/
authenticity. You give the recipient(trusted) public key. The recipient will hash
the file again to see if the summary match. To further ensuring it comes from you
the sender, the recipient will decrypt the encrypted summary to see if it matches
with the normal non encrypted summary. 

This process ensures that the file/document/data/other that might applicable has 
data integrity and authenticity. Just like in real life, we put signatures on
certain document. PKCS digital signature is an enhanced version of real life
signature.
